## Short Bio

I am a last year Ph.D. student at the [Centre Borelli of the ENS Paris-Saclay](https://centreborelli.ens-paris-saclay.fr/en) in France. My thesis is sponsored by the [Michelin tire company](https://www.michelin.com/en/) and conducted under the supervison of [Pr. Mathilde Mougeot](https://sites.google.com/site/mougeotmathilde/), [Pr. Nicolas Vayatis](https://nvayatis.perso.math.cnrs.fr/) and [Fran√ßois Deheeger](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/fran%C3%A7ois-deheeger-88370054).

My research focuses on developing reliable machine learning models under the intrinsic constraints of engineering design, such as domain shift and costly labeling. I am particularly interested in transfer learning, domain adaptation, active learning, uncertainty quantification, and out-of-distribution detection.
