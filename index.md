## Short Bio

I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [Sloan Kettering Institute for Cancer Research](https://www.mskcc.org/research/ski), where I develop deep generative models and active learning algorithms to discover effective combination therapies.

I earned a Ph.D. at the [Centre Borelli of the ENS Paris-Saclay](https://centreborelli.ens-paris-saclay.fr/en) in France. My thesis was sponsored by the [Michelin tire company](https://www.michelin.com/en/) and conducted under the supervision of [Pr. Mathilde Mougeot](https://sites.google.com/site/mougeotmathilde/), [Pr. Nicolas Vayatis](https://nvayatis.perso.math.cnrs.fr/) and [Fran√ßois Deheeger](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/fran%C3%A7ois-deheeger-88370054). My thesis focuses on developing reliable machine learning models under the intrinsic constraints of engineering design, such as domain shift and costly labeling.

I am particularly interested in developing translational ML research that can make a meaningful impact on real-world challenges, particularly in industrial and medical applications. To achieve this, my research focuses on transfer learning, domain adaptation, active learning, uncertainty quantification, and out-of-distribution detection.
